Generative Adversial Network using MNIST Data

## Steps of GAN Algorithm

1. The generator takes in random numbers and returns an image.
2. This generated image is fed into the discriminator alongside a stream of images taken from the actual, ground-truth dataset.
3. The discriminator takes in both real and fake images and returns probabilities, a number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a prediction of authenticity and 0 representing fake.
